# Babble Buds

> This is an **ALPHA** release. It is not yet feature complete, and existing features are not thoroughly tested. 

A public, open source version of URealms' Puppet Pals software, written in electron and PIXI.js

## Why not just use Marionette Mates?

Well, until I port over all the puppets in Marionette Mates, that might be the best choice for you. However, already this program has the following advantages:

- Native executables for each platform (Win, macOS, and Linux)
- Better performance
- Cleaner, more useful UI
- The show panel can be popped out
- Much more customizations, each of which can be edited without needing to touch physical files
- No need to run a separate program to start hosting
- Support for multiple project folders

... and many more will come between now and the 1.0 release. 

## Roadmap to 1.0

- Integrated editor
- Configurable local AND global hotkeys
- Syncing characters and assets to clients
- Convert rest of puppets available in Marionette Mates (and efficiently convert things like the mouths and eyes)

## Thanks

Thanks to Marionette Mates for ripping assets so I didn't have to. 

The graphical parts of the program use PIXI.JS, which is awesome because I want to make your Babble Buds project files usable in RPG Maker MV to create scripted babble buds-esque dialogue.
